# Support — Genesis‑X

Thanks for using Genesis‑X! This page explains where and how to get help.

## Where to ask

- **Bugs** → open a GitHub Issue (category: Bug). Provide logs and repro steps.
- **Features & questions** → open a GitHub Issue (Feature request / Q&A).
- **Security vulnerabilities** → **do not** open a public issue. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).  
- **Commercial support or sponsorships** → email **sponsors@kooijman-inc.com**.

- **Qt version** (e.g., 6.10) and **Qt Creator version** (e.g., 17.0.2)
- Steps to reproduce (minimal example if possible)
- Expected vs. actual result
- For Android:
  - The Gradle error snippet
  - The generated `core/android-template/gradle.properties` (sanitized if needed)
