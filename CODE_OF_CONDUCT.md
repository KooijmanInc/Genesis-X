# Code of Conduct — Genesis‑X

We want Genesis‑X to be a welcoming, professional community. This Code of Conduct explains what we expect from everyone who participates (maintainers, contributors, users).

## Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in the project a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Positive behavior includes:
- Showing empathy and respect for differing opinions and experiences.
- Offering and accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Giving credit where due and acknowledging mistakes.

### Unacceptable behavior includes:
- Harassment, intimidation, stalking, or threats.
- Discriminatory or sexualized language or imagery; sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment; publishing others’ private information (doxing).
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Scope
This Code applies within all project spaces (repositories, issues, pull/merge requests, discussions, chats) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or community.

## Enforcement
Report violations by emailing **sponsors@kooijman-inc.com** (preferred) or by using GitHub/GitLab reporting tools. Include as much detail as you can (links, screenshots, timestamps).

Project maintainers will review and respond in good faith as quickly as practical. Reports will be handled confidentially when possible; limited information may be shared to conduct an investigation.

The maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warnings and temporary or permanent restrictions.

## Enforcement Guidelines
To clarify what behavior consequences may follow, maintainers may use these guidelines.

1. **Correction**  
   **Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.  
   **Consequence:** A private, written warning with clarity around expected behavior. A public apology may be requested.

2. **Warning**  
   **Community Impact:** A single incident or series of actions that violate the Code.  
   **Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code, for a specified period.

3. **Temporary Restriction**  
   **Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including continued inappropriate behavior after warnings.  
   **Consequence:** Temporary ban from interaction or public communication channels for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the community or maintainers is allowed during this period.

4. **Permanent Restriction**  
   **Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.  
   **Consequence:** Permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Maintainers’ Responsibilities
- Clarify standards of acceptable behavior and take appropriate and fair corrective action.  
- Remove, edit, or reject contributions not aligned with this Code, and temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.  
- Recuse themselves from cases where they have a conflict of interest.
