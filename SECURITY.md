# Security Policy

We take security seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Genesis‑X, please **do not** open a public issue.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Email: **security@kooijman-inc.com** (or sponsors@kooijman-inc.com)

Please include:
- A description of the issue and potential impact
- A minimal reproduction (if possible)
- Affected versions/commit(s) and platform
- Any relevant logs or crash reports

We aim to acknowledge reports within **5 business days** and provide a timeline for a fix or mitigation where possible.

## Supported Versions

We generally provide security fixes for the latest **minor** release and the current development branch:

| Version | Supported |
|--------:|:---------:|
| main    | ✅ |
| latest tag (X.Y.Z) | ✅ |
| older releases | ❌ |

If you require backports for older versions under a commercial agreement, contact **security@kooijman-inc.com**.

## Public Disclosure

Once a fix is available, we prefer coordinated disclosure: we’ll publish release notes and credit reporters (if desired). If you believe users are at immediate risk, mention this in your email and we’ll triage with urgency.
